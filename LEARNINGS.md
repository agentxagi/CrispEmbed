# CrispEmbed — Technical Learnings

## DeBERTa rel_embd must be dequantized for CPU-side expansion

DeBERTa's relative position embeddings are expanded on CPU (log-bucket
indexing → [H, T*T] tensor) before the ggml graph runs. With quantized
models (Q8_0/Q4_K), the `rel_embd.weight` tensor is no longer F32 —
reading it via `ggml_backend_tensor_get` gives raw quantized bytes.
Must use `tensor_to_f32_backend()` which reads raw bytes then calls
`ggml_get_type_traits(type)->to_float()` to dequantize. Same applies
to `encoder_ln_w/b` used in the LayerNorm applied to rel_embd.

## Dual-backbone GLiNER: parameterize span mode and hidden dim

GLiNER models differ in span representation mode:
- markerV1 (LFM2): concat(proj_start, proj_end, proj_first) → 3*hidden
- markerV0 (DeBERTa): concat(proj_start, proj_end) → 2*hidden

The out_project MLP input dimension changes accordingly. Parameterize
`span_cat_dim` based on span_mode rather than hardcoding `3*hidden`.
Also parameterize `head_dim_gl` (GLiNER head dimension) separately from
`enc_hidden` (encoder output dimension) to handle the 768→512 projection.

## PARSeq two-stream decoder (XLNet-style attention)

PARSeq's decoder uses a two-stream design from XLNet where both position
queries and content tokens are maintained separately. Key details:

1. **Token ordering is non-standard**: `[EOS=0, chars=1..94, BOS=95, PAD=96]`.
   The head output excludes BOS and PAD, so it has 95 classes (0=EOS + 94 chars).
   This is because `BaseTokenizer` puts `specials_first=(EOS,)` before charset
   and `specials_last=(BOS,PAD)` after.

2. **Context construction**: The content stream at decode position k is NOT just
   the token embedding. It's `pos_queries[k-1] + embed(token_k)` for k>=1, and
   just `embed(BOS)` for k=0 (no position query for BOS — it's "null context").

3. **norm_c is essential**: Context K/V in self-attention are normalized by
   `norm_c` (LayerNorm), while queries are normalized by `norm_q`. Skipping
   norm_c produces garbage.

4. **Efficient AR decode**: At step i, only one query position is used
   (`pos_queries[i]`), with context tokens 0..i. No causal mask needed since
   T=i+1 and all positions are visible. The paper's `query_mask` only matters
   for the full N-step forward (training/refinement).

5. **Non-square patch kernel**: Patch embedding uses Conv2d with kernel [4,8]
   (height 4, width 8). ggml_conv_2d doesn't support non-square kernels, so
   patch embedding runs CPU-side as a manual extract+matmul.

## ggml GQA broadcasting (critical for decoder models)

`ggml_mul_mat` natively broadcasts ne[2] when `b->ne[2] % a->ne[2] == 0`.
For GQA (16 Q heads, 8 KV heads): **do NOT explicitly repeat K/V**.
`ggml_repeat` tiles `[h0..h7, h0..h7]` which is WRONG for GQA (should
be `[h0,h0,h1,h1,...]`). Just let mul_mat broadcast — it handles the
interleaved head mapping correctly internally.

Also: after attention, reshape to `q_dim = n_heads × head_dim` (NOT
`hidden_size`). For GQA models, q_dim ≠ hidden_size (e.g. 2048 vs 1024).

## BERT post-LN vs pre-LN

BERT uses post-LayerNorm: `attn → residual_add → LN → FFN → residual_add → LN`.
Many newer models (GPT, LLaMA) use pre-LN. Getting this wrong produces
output that looks plausible but has completely wrong magnitudes.

## RoPE application order

For Qwen3: RoPE is applied on `[head_dim, n_heads, T]` tensor (BEFORE
permute to `[head_dim, T, n_heads]`). `ggml_rope_ext` requires ne[2]=T
(the position dimension), which matches the unpermuted layout. Applying
RoPE after permute crashes with dimension mismatch.

At position 0, RoPE is identity (cos=1, sin=0), so position-0 values
match regardless of whether RoPE is applied. Debug with position > 0
to verify RoPE correctness.

## Tokenizer types for embedding models

| Model family | Tokenizer | Implementation |
|---|---|---|
| BERT/MiniLM/GTE | WordPiece | Greedy longest-match with ## prefix |
| XLM-RoBERTa/E5/Arctic/PIXIE | SentencePiece Unigram | Viterbi DP (NOT bigram merge) |
| Qwen3/Octen/F2LLM | GPT-2 BPE | core_bpe byte-level BPE with merges |
| Gemma3/Harrier-270M | SentencePiece BPE | BPE merges with ▁ space marker + BOS/EOS |

Auto-detected from GGUF metadata: `tokenizer.ggml.type` (0=WP, 1=BPE, 2=SP)
or heuristic (vocab > 100K → SentencePiece).

### Critical: SentencePiece Unigram needs Viterbi, not bigram merge

The llama.cpp-style bigram merge (priority queue, highest-score-first)
does NOT produce correct tokenization for Unigram models like XLM-R.
Example: "▁world" exists as token 8999, but bigram merge breaks it into
["▁w", "or", "ld"] because greedy pair merging can't find the global optimum.

**Viterbi DP**: For each position i, try all vocab tokens ending at i,
pick the segmentation with the highest total score. O(n × max_token_len).
This matches HuggingFace's `tokenizers` library exactly.

### SentencePiece BPE vs GPT-2 BPE

These are different tokenizer families with different pre-processing:
- GPT-2 BPE: byte-level encoding (spaces → Ġ), no BOS/EOS by default
- SentencePiece BPE (Gemma): spaces → ▁ (U+2581), BOS/EOS tokens

### Vocab scores for SentencePiece

SentencePiece Unigram models need per-token scores for Viterbi. These come from:
1. `tokenizer.sp_model.GetScore(i)` — but not available for all tokenizer classes
2. `tokenizer.json` → `model.vocab` → list of `[token, score]` pairs

If scores are missing (all zeros), the tokenizer degenerates to random merging.

## Per-op debugging methodology

Same as CrispASR: dump every intermediate tensor from BOTH HF reference
and our ggml graph, compare at each stage. The divergence point identifies
the exact broken operation. For Octen-Embedding-0.6B, this revealed:
- input_ln: MATCH
- q_proj/k_proj: MATCH
- q_norm/k_norm: MATCH
- o_proj: MISMATCH → GQA repeat was wrong
- Fix: remove ggml_repeat, let mul_mat broadcast → MATCH

## RoBERTa/XLM-R position embedding offset

RoBERTa-family models (XLM-R, PIXIE-Rune, arctic-embed-l-v2) offset position
IDs by `padding_idx + 1 = 2`. Position IDs for a 4-token sequence are
`[2, 3, 4, 5]`, not `[0, 1, 2, 3]`. Position embedding index 1 is all-zeros
(padding), index 0 is low-norm. Getting this wrong produces ~0.74 cosine sim
instead of 0.999.

Stored as `bert.position_offset` in GGUF metadata.

## Gemma3 architecture specifics

Gemma3 (Harrier-270M) differs from Qwen3/LLaMA in several critical ways:

1. **RMSNorm uses `(1 + weight)`**: Gemma3 RMSNorm computes
   `output * (1.0 + weight)` instead of `output * weight`. The stored weights
   do NOT include the +1 offset. Missing this makes all layer outputs wrong.

2. **Embedding scale**: Token embeddings are multiplied by `sqrt(hidden_size)`.
   The exact value is stored in `embed_tokens.embed_scale` (f16 precision:
   `sqrt(640) ≈ 25.25` not `25.298`).

3. **Extra norms**: 4 norms per layer (not 2):
   - `input_layernorm` → before attention
   - `post_attention_layernorm` → after attention, BEFORE residual add
   - `pre_feedforward_layernorm` → before FFN
   - `post_feedforward_layernorm` → after FFN, BEFORE residual add

4. **Attention scaling**: Uses `query_pre_attn_scalar` (= head_dim) instead
   of `sqrt(head_dim)`. Scale = `1/sqrt(qpas)`.

5. **gelu_pytorch_tanh**: Activation function; ggml_gelu uses tanh approx.

6. **head_dim != hidden_size/n_heads**: Gemma3 has head_dim=256, hidden=640,
   n_heads=4. Standard calculation gives 160, but explicit head_dim is 256.

7. **SentencePiece BPE tokenizer**: Uses ▁ space marker (not GPT-2 Ġ),
   needs BOS(2) at start and EOS(1) at end.

## Ollama integration learnings

### Architecture: Ollama uses ggml via CGO (same as CrispEmbed)

Both Ollama and CrispEmbed use ggml for tensor computation. Ollama wraps ggml
ops in Go structs via CGO (`C.ggml_mul_mat`, `C.ggml_rms_norm`). CrispEmbed
calls ggml directly from C++. The computation graphs are functionally identical.

### Phantom-space token vocabulary (critical for WordPiece)

Ollama's WordPiece tokenizer expects tokens in SentencePiece-style format:
- `"hello"` → `"▁hello"` (prepend ▁)
- `"##ing"` → `"ing"` (strip ##)
- `"[CLS]"` → `"[CLS]"` (keep special tokens)

Without this transformation, cos drops from 1.0 to ~0.19.

### GELU variant matters (exact erf vs tanh approximation)

BERT uses exact GELU (erf-based). Ollama's `.GELU()` uses tanh approximation
(`ggml_gelu_inplace`). Must use `.GELU_ERF()` for BERT/XLM-R encoder models.
Difference: cos 0.996 → 1.000.

### SentencePiece Unigram needs Viterbi DP, not pairwise merge

Ollama's existing `SentencePiece` tokenizer uses BPE-style greedy pairwise
merge (priority queue). This is WRONG for Unigram models (XLM-R, e5-small).
We added `SentencePieceUnigram` using Viterbi DP (same as CrispEmbed's
tokenizer_spm.cpp). Must also prepend space before tokenization.

### Gemma3 (1+weight) RMSNorm must be pre-baked for Ollama

Ollama's RMSNorm does `rms_norm(x) * weight`. Gemma3 needs `rms_norm(x) * (1 + weight)`.
CrispEmbed handles this at runtime with a `ones` tensor. For Ollama export,
pre-add +1 to all norm weights in the GGUF.

### Quantized token_types breaks Ollama binary ops

Ollama's ggml doesn't support `f32 + q8_0` in elementwise ops. The tiny
`token_types.weight` tensor (2 rows) must be kept as f32 during quantization.
Error: `binary_op: unsupported types: dst: f32, src0: f32, src1: q8_0`.

### Nil-guards needed for optional model components

Ollama's Qwen3 model.go unconditionally calls `QueryNorm.Forward()` — panics
for models without QK-norm (e.g. Jina v5). Gemma3 embed.go unconditionally
iterates `Dense` projection — panics for models without it (Harrier-270M).

### Jina v5 LoRA adapters need merge before export

Jina v5 models use task-specific LoRA adapters (retrieval, classification,
clustering, text-matching). Must call `model.set_adapter("retrieval")` then
`model.merge_and_unload()` before GGUF export. The `encode()` method does
more than standard forward+pool, so merged output won't exactly match HF.

### SentencePiece BERT models should use bert arch, not xlmr

Models like multilingual-e5-small report `model_type="bert"` with SentencePiece
tokenizer. These are BERT models (no position offset), not XLM-R. Only true
`roberta`/`xlm-roberta` types need the `xlmr` arch with position offset.

`paraphrase-multilingual-MiniLM-L12-v2` is another instance of this pattern —
BERT (post-LN) body + 250K-token XLM-R SentencePiece-Unigram vocab. The
converter detects this from `config.model_type == "bert"` and writes
`bert.position_offset = 0`. End-to-end cosine vs HF: **1.000000** on f16/f32,
**197/197 encoder tensors bit-exact** (max\|Δ\|=0) — see
`tests/parity_layers_bert.py`.

### SPLADE detection must look at checkpoint files, not state_dict

`AutoModelForMaskedLM.from_pretrained()` will *silently random-initialise*
missing `cls.predictions.*` keys instead of failing. Checking
`any("cls.predictions" in k for k in model.state_dict())` therefore returns
True for **every** plain encoder checkpoint, baking a random MLM head into
the GGUF (~600 KB of garbage tensors that load as "MLM/SPLADE head loaded"
at runtime).

The fix in `models/convert-bert-to-gguf.py` is to peek at the safetensors /
pytorch_model.bin header directly via `safe_open()` and only call
`AutoModelForMaskedLM` if `cls.predictions.` or `lm_head.` keys are
**actually present in the checkpoint**. `output_loading_info=True` looked
like an obvious alternative but returns inconsistent shapes (single model
vs 5-tuple) depending on `use_safetensors`, so the header-peek path is the
robust one.

This bug affected every plain `sentence-transformers/*` and `all-MiniLM-*`
conversion prior to 2026-05-11. Re-converting those models drops the file
size by ~1 MB each and removes the misleading "MLM head loaded" log line.

## PPFormulaNet-S / Texo-Distill OCR port

### MBart uses PRE-LN, not POST-LN

Despite MBart config saying `layer_norm_eps` and having `*_layer_norm` weights,
the HuggingFace MBart decoder applies **PRE-LN**: LayerNorm before attention/FFN,
with the residual connection skipping the LN. The TrOCR decoder (math_ocr.cpp)
uses POST-LN. Getting this wrong produces completely different logit distributions
— the first token diverges from logit 16.1 (correct) to 1.7 (wrong).

```
PRE-LN (MBart):                    POST-LN (TrOCR):
  residual = x                        Q = linear(x)
  x = LN(x)                          ...attn...
  Q = linear(x)                      x = x + attn_out
  ...attn...                          x = LN(x)
  x = residual + attn_out
```

The encoder diff test (cos=1.0) will NOT catch decoder LN ordering bugs —
you MUST also dump and compare decoder layer outputs from the Python reference.

### ODR violations from shared struct names

Multiple `.cpp` files defining `struct dec_layer` in the anonymous namespace
causes One Definition Rule violations. The linker may silently use the wrong
definition (144 bytes from decoder_embed_internal.h instead of 208 bytes from
ppformulanet_ocr.cpp), causing heap-buffer-overflow in `map_tensors`. ASAN
catches this immediately. Fix: use unique struct names (`ppfn_dec_layer`).

### UniMERNet preprocessing is NOT ImageNet

PPFormulaNet-S/Texo uses UniMERNet's image processor:
- Convert to grayscale, replicate to 3ch
- Resize preserving aspect ratio, pad with **black** (not white)
- Normalize: **mean=0.7931, std=0.1738** (NOT ImageNet 0.485/0.229)
- Input is always 384x384

Using ImageNet normalization produces garbage output even though the encoder
activations look reasonable — the model was trained with different pixel statistics.

### HGNetv2 StemBlock padding

StemBlock uses kernel_size=2 convolutions (stem2a, stem2b) with padding=0.
Before each, the input must be explicitly padded with `F.pad(x, (0,1,0,1))`.
Without this, the spatial dimensions mismatch at the concat step (pool output
vs stem2b output differ by 1 pixel).

### Conv-BN folding for CNN encoders

BatchNorm after Conv2d can be algebraically folded at conversion time:
```
fused_w = conv_w * (bn_weight / sqrt(bn_var + eps))
fused_b = bn_bias - bn_mean * (bn_weight / sqrt(bn_var + eps))
```
This eliminates all BN parameters from the GGUF, saving memory and compute.
The BTTR/HMER ports already did this; PPFormulaNet has ~150 BN layers to fold.

### 20M models are too small for Q4_K

The Texo-distill model (20M params, 384 d_model) produces identical output at
F32/F16/Q8_0, but Q4_K degrades noticeably — subscripts become wrong, tokens
repeat. The attention projections (384x384) and embedding table (1264x384) are
small enough that 4-bit quantization loses critical precision. Ship Q8_0 (22 MB)
as the smallest reliable variant.

### Debug prints: gate behind env vars, never remove

Decoder debug fprintf traces (`tok_emb+pos`, `after embed_ln`, `logits[91]`)
were essential for diagnosing the PRE-LN bug. Gate them behind
`getenv("PPFN_DEBUG")` rather than deleting. The crispembed-diff harness only
validates the encoder — decoder bugs require manual layer-by-layer tracing.

## Quantization notes

### Python gguf vs C++ quantizer

The Python `gguf` library (`pip install gguf`) only implements quantization
for basic types: Q4_0, Q5_0, Q5_1, Q8_0. K-quants (Q4_K, Q5_K, Q6_K) are
listed in the enum but `quantize_blocks` raises `NotImplementedError`.

Additionally, the Python library's string array handling in GGUFReader/GGUFWriter
can corrupt metadata when copying GGUF files — we observed Q8_0 models from the
Python quantizer producing cos=0.78 vs the same model's F32, while the C++ quantizer
produces cos=0.9997.

**Use the C++ quantizer for all quantization.** It calls ggml's native
`ggml_quantize_chunk` which supports all types including K-quants.

### Embedding tables and aggressive quantization

Token embedding tables (`token_embd.weight`) are very sensitive to quantization.
Quantizing them to Q4_K degrades output quality significantly (cos drops from
0.999 to 0.71 for some models). The CrispEmbed quantizer keeps embedding tables
at F32 for Q4_K/Q5_K; only Q8_0 and F16 are allowed to touch them.

### K-quant fallback chain

K-quants (Q4_K/Q5_K/Q6_K) require row widths divisible by 256. Many embedding
model tensors have rows of 384 or 768 which aren't 256-aligned. The quantizer
falls back: Q4_K→Q4_0, Q5_K→Q5_0, Q6_K→Q8_0. This means small-dim models
get Q4_0 instead of Q4_K for most tensors.

### ggml_get_rows for quantized embeddings

The BERT encoder must use `ggml_get_rows` (ggml graph op) for embedding table
lookup, not manual `ggml_backend_tensor_get` with float pointer arithmetic.
`ggml_get_rows` handles dequantization internally and works with any tensor type.
Manual CPU-side extraction assumes F32 layout and crashes on quantized models.

## Server performance: buffer reuse

The biggest server-mode optimization is reusing `graph_buf` and `work_buf` across
encode calls. Without this, every request allocates ~50-200MB (graph context +
compute workspace), causing 3x overhead from malloc/free.

With buffer reuse: gte-small goes from 8.8 to 27.8 texts/sec (3.2x improvement).

## BLAS/MKL for embedding models

BLAS (OpenBLAS/MKL) provides minimal benefit for embedding inference because:
- Quantized kernels (Q8_0/Q4_K) use ggml's SIMD paths, not BLAS
- BERT encoder matrices are moderate-sized (384x384 to 1024x4096)
- BLAS overhead dominates for small matrices

For CPU speed: use Q8_0 quantization. For GPU: build with `-DGGML_CUDA=ON` or
`-DGGML_VULKAN=ON` — the `ggml_backend_sched` dispatcher handles offloading.

## ggml_backend_sched with CPU-only

When using `ggml_backend_sched` in CPU-only mode, calling it repeatedly with
different graphs causes segfaults because the scheduler holds stale tensor
references from freed graph contexts. Solution: only create the scheduler when
a GPU backend is detected (`!ggml_backend_is_cpu(backend)`). For CPU-only,
direct `ggml_graph_compute` with a persistent work buffer is faster anyway.

## Matmul optimization — what we use, what's available

### Current state (as of April 2026)

Our embedding models have small matrices: 384×384 (MiniLM/GTE) to 1024×4096
(Qwen3 FFN). For these sizes, overhead per matmul call matters more than
raw FLOP throughput.

### CPU matmul options (ggml-cpu)

| Option | Default | Effect | Our impact |
|--------|---------|--------|-----------|
| `GGML_LLAMAFILE` | OFF | Custom SGEMM kernels optimized for small F32 matmul | **HIGH** for F32 models |
| `GGML_AVX512` | OFF | 512-bit SIMD (2x wider than AVX2) | **HIGH** if CPU supports |
| `GGML_AVX512_VNNI` | OFF | Hardware int8 dot products | Medium for Q8_0 models |
| `GGML_AMX_TILE` | OFF | Intel AMX for int8/BF16 (Sapphire Rapids+) | None (needs new CPU) |
| `GGML_OPENMP` | ON | Thread parallelism | Already enabled |

**Enable for best CPU performance:**
```bash
cmake -S . -B build -DGGML_LLAMAFILE=ON   # custom SGEMM
cmake -S . -B build -DGGML_AVX512=ON      # if CPU supports (check /proc/cpuinfo)
```

### CUDA matmul options

| Option | Default | Effect |
|--------|---------|--------|
| `GGML_CUDA_FA` | ON | Flash attention CUDA kernel |
| `GGML_CUDA_GRAPHS` | OFF | Multi-op fusion via CUDA graph capture |
| `GGML_CUDA_FORCE_MMQ` | OFF | Force quantized matmul kernels (vs cuBLAS) |
| `GGML_CUDA_FA_ALL_QUANTS` | OFF | Flash attn for all quant types |

CUDA auto-selects between MMQ (quantized matmul) and cuBLAS (F32) based
on matrix size and GPU compute capability. For our 384×384 Q8_0 matrices,
MMQ is usually selected (faster than cuBLAS for small quantized matmul).

### Why HF PyTorch is still competitive on CUDA

HF PyTorch uses cuBLAS with operator fusion via torch.compile/TorchScript.
For a 22M-param model (MiniLM), the GPU is underutilized — compute time
is dominated by kernel launch overhead and memory transfers, not FLOP
throughput. Both HF and CrispEmbed run at ~10ms, limited by the GPU's
minimum latency per kernel launch (~5μs × ~200 kernels = ~1ms overhead).

### Batched matmul on GPU

Single matmul `W[H,H] × X[H, T*B]` is much faster than B separate
`W[H,H] × X[H, T]` calls because:
1. One cuBLAS/MMQ launch vs B launches
2. Better GPU occupancy (more work per SM)
3. Memory access amortization

Our true batched graph concatenates all texts and uses 4D flash attention
with batch dimension. The matmuls naturally batch via the flattened T*B dim.

### QKV weight fusion

Pre-merging Q/K/V weight matrices into `[H, 3H]` reduces 3 matmul calls
to 1 per layer. The merged tensor must live in the same backend buffer as
the model weights (ggml_backend_alloc_ctx_tensors) so it works on GPU.

On CPU: ~0.5ms savings (15.3ms vs 16.8ms for MiniLM).
On GPU: minor savings (kernel launch overhead reduction).

## Optimization experiment results (April 2026)

| Optimization | CPU Impact | GPU Impact | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| QKV weight fusion (1 matmul vs 3) | 15.3ms vs 17.0ms (**+11%**) | minor | **Keep** — matmul reduction wins |
| Flash attention (fused QKV attn) | 16.8→15.3ms | significant | **Keep** |
| Scheduler reservation (bucket T) | no change | may help | Keep (no cost) |
| GGML_LLAMAFILE | 15.3→14.7ms (**+4%**) | N/A | **Enable by default** |
| AVX512 (if CPU supports) | 15.3→14.4ms (**+6%**) | N/A | Enable if available |
| F16 model weights | 15.3→17.7ms (**-14%**) | may help (tensor cores) | **Skip on CPU** |
| Removing ggml_cont (no QKV fusion) | 15.3→17.0ms (**-10%**) | N/A | Don't remove |
| True batched graph (4D flash attn) | slower on CPU | should help | GPU only |

### Why we can't easily match HF PyTorch

1. **Graph rebuild cost**: ggml rebuilds the graph from scratch every call (~1ms).
   PyTorch JIT-compiles and caches the execution plan.
2. **No CPU operator fusion**: ggml CPU executes each op separately (separate memory pass
   for norm, mul, add). ORT/PyTorch fuse these into single kernels.
3. **No persistent CUDA graphs**: PyTorch can capture and replay GPU command streams.
   ggml has `GGML_CUDA_GRAPHS` but it's designed for llama.cpp's specific graph topology.
4. **Batch matmul**: PyTorch's cuBLAS wrapper handles batched matmul natively.
   Our 4D reshape + flash attention adds overhead vs native batch support.

### Practical CPU performance ceiling

For MiniLM (22M params, 6 layers, 384d) on 4-thread CPU:
- **15.3ms** with all optimizations (QKV fusion + flash attn + llamafile)
- **~14ms** theoretical minimum (pure matmul compute time)
- **~1ms** graph rebuild overhead we can't eliminate
- HF PyTorch on same CPU: **54ms** (CrispEmbed is **3.5x faster on CPU**)

### Practical GPU performance ceiling

For MiniLM on RTX A1000 (budget laptop GPU):
- **10.6ms** current (with all optimizations)
- **~5ms** theoretical minimum (kernel launch overhead + small matrix underutilization)
- HF PyTorch: **9.5ms** (they have better GPU batching)
- Gap is ~1ms — likely kernel launch overhead from ggml's per-op dispatch

## Windows build

Windows users often forget `--recursive` when cloning. The CMakeLists.txt now
checks for `ggml/CMakeLists.txt` existence and prints a helpful error message.
Build scripts (`build-windows.bat`, `build-vulkan.bat`, `build-cuda.bat`) auto-
detect VS2022 and Vulkan/CUDA SDKs.

## ggml operator fusion — what exists, what doesn't

### Existing fused ops (backend-specific)

**CUDA** (automatic when graph patterns match):
- RMSNorm + Mul (`ggml_cuda_op_rms_norm_fused`)
- RMSNorm + Mul + Add (`ggml_cuda_op_rms_norm_fused_add`)
- Multi-Add (up to 8 chained adds → 1 kernel)
- FFN gate: MUL_MAT + ADD + MUL_MAT + ADD + GLU → 1 kernel
- RoPE + SetRows fused
- Unary + Mul (SILU/Sigmoid/Softplus)

**Vulkan**: Add + RMSNorm (controlled by `GGML_VK_DISABLE_FUSION`)
**Metal**: Generic fusion framework with `use_fusion` flag
**CPU**: **No fusion at all** — every op executes individually

### What this means for performance

On **CPU**, there's a fundamental ~3x gap vs ONNX Runtime because:
1. ORT does Level3 graph JIT compilation: constant folding, op fusion, layout
   optimization, kernel selection — all at graph compile time
2. ggml has no graph optimization pass; fusion only happens in GPU backends
   during compute, not at graph construction time
3. Each ggml CPU op does a separate memory pass (read+write). Fusing
   LayerNorm (norm+mul+add = 3 passes) into 1 pass saves bandwidth

On **GPU (CUDA)**, the gap should be much smaller because:
1. CUDA backend automatically fuses RMSNorm+Mul, FFN gates, multi-add
2. `ggml_flash_attn_ext` runs as a single fused CUDA kernel
3. Matmul uses cuBLAS (same as PyTorch/ONNX)
4. Memory bandwidth is 10-20x higher on GPU, so fusion matters less

### What we optimized (practical CPU-side)

1. **Pre-merged QKV weights**: concatenate Q/K/V weight matrices into one
   [H, 3H] tensor at load time. One matmul instead of three per layer.
   Saves ~0.5ms for 6-layer 384d model.

2. **Flash attention**: `ggml_flash_attn_ext` replaces 8 separate ops
   (permute, cont, mul_mat, scale, softmax, mul_mat, permute, reshape)

3. **Graph caching**: build ggml graph once per sequence length, reuse
   across calls. Eliminates ~3ms of ggml_init + graph construction.

4. **Buffer reuse**: graph_buf and work_buf persist across calls.

### Why not modify ggml for CPU fusion?

Considered but impractical because:
- ggml's CPU backend is designed for portability (pure C + SIMD intrinsics)
- Adding a graph optimization pass would affect all ggml users
- The `ggml_map_custom` API allows custom kernels but doesn't help with
  matmul (the expensive op) — ggml's SIMD matmul is already well-optimized
- Fusing norm+mul+add saves < 0.1ms per text (memory-bound, not compute-bound)
- The 3x gap to ONNX is dominated by ORT's matmul scheduling and cache
  optimization, not by op fusion per se

### GPU prediction

On CUDA, CrispEmbed should match or beat ONNX because:
- cuBLAS matmul is the same engine ORT uses
- ggml's CUDA fusion handles the same patterns ORT fuses
- Flash attention is implemented as a single CUDA kernel
- No Python/ONNX overhead in our C++ server

Estimated GPU performance for MiniLM (RTX 3060):
- CrispEmbed CUDA: ~2-4ms (model fits entirely in GPU memory)
- fastembed ONNX+CUDA: ~2-4ms (cuBLAS + graph optimization)
- Likely on par, with CrispEmbed winning on server overhead

## Prompt prefix system for RAG models

Many embedding models require query/passage prefixes for optimal retrieval:
- BGE: `"Represent this sentence for searching relevant passages: "`
- E5: `"query: "` / `"passage: "`
- Nomic: `"search_query: "` / `"search_document: "`
- Jina v5: `"Query: "` / `"Document: "`

Implementation: prefix is stored in `crispembed_context::prefix` and prepended
to the raw text before tokenization in both `crispembed_encode()` and
`crispembed_encode_batch()`. This is correct because:
1. The prefix is part of the semantic input (not a tokenizer-level construct)
2. All tokenizer types (WordPiece/SentencePiece/BPE) handle it naturally
3. fastembed-rs does the same (injects prefix before tokenizer.encode)

**Not applied to sparse/colbert/reranker**: These have different input semantics.
Sparse retrieval operates on raw terms. Rerankers take (query, document) pairs
where the model handles the joint encoding.

## Bi-encoder vs cross-encoder reranking

Both approaches are valuable for RAG and complement each other:

**Bi-encoder** (embed query + docs independently, cosine similarity):
- Fast: encode once, compare N documents with dot products
- Same model used for initial retrieval AND reranking
- Quality limited by the embedding space
- CrispEmbed: `rerank_biencoder()` in Python/Rust, uses `encode_batch()` + dot product

**Cross-encoder** (encode query-document pairs jointly):
- Slow: each (query, doc) pair requires a full forward pass
- Much higher quality (joint attention between query and document tokens)
- Typically used as second-stage reranker after bi-encoder retrieval
- CrispEmbed: `rerank()` in Python/Rust, uses `crispembed_rerank()` C API

**RAG pipeline pattern**: bi-encoder retrieval (top-100) → cross-encoder reranking (top-10)

## Model registry for RAG feature parity

When adding new models to the registry (`model_mgr.cpp`), the key metadata is:
- **name**: short name for CLI/auto-download
- **filename**: GGUF filename (may include `-q8_0` suffix for default quant)
- **url**: HuggingFace direct download URL under `cstr/` namespace
- **desc**: architecture, dimension, language, parameter count

Models that are encoder-only (BERT/XLM-R) use the existing convert-bert-to-gguf.py.
Models that are decoder-based (Qwen3/Gemma3) use convert-decoder-embed-to-gguf.py.
Rerankers are encoder models with a classifier head — use `--crisp` flag to include
the classifier weights in the GGUF.

## MPNet relative position bias

MPNet uses T5-style relative position bias instead of absolute position embeddings.
The bias is a learned `Embedding(32, 12)` — 32 logarithmic distance buckets × 12
attention heads. For each (query_pos, key_pos) pair, a bucket index is computed
via logarithmic distance binning, then the bias is looked up and added to
attention scores before softmax.

**Our implementation** (CrispEmbed):
- Precompute the full `[T, T, n_heads]` bias matrix in C++ at encode time
- Pass it as the F16 mask parameter to `ggml_flash_attn_ext`
- Flash attention adds it to scores natively — no manual attention needed
- Result: cos=0.999997 vs HuggingFace

**llama.cpp approach** (PR #21880):
- Compute bucket indices in the ggml graph via `build_inp_pos_bucket_enc()`
- Look up bias weights with `build_pos_bias()` (ggml graph ops)
- Pass as `kq_b` to `build_attn()` which adds it to attention scores
- Tensor stored transposed `[n_heads, n_buckets]` on layer 0

**Key difference**: We precompute in C++ (simpler, works on CPU), they compute in
the ggml graph (GPU-accelerable, more modular). Both produce identical results.
Our approach is ~10 lines of C++ vs their ~50 lines of graph builder code.

**Bugs found during MPNet implementation**:
- Python `or` operator treats `cls_token_id=0` as falsy → falls through to
  default 101. Fix: use `is not None` check
- MPNet needs position offset = 2 (same as RoBERTa), but `model_type="mpnet"`
  was not included in the offset detection

## Reranker model conversion notes

Cross-encoder rerankers (bge-reranker, ms-marco-MiniLM, mxbai-rerank) have a
classifier head on top of the encoder:
- **1-layer**: `classifier.dense.weight [H,1]` + `classifier.dense.bias [1]`
  → CLS hidden → Linear → scalar score
- **2-layer** (RobertaClassificationHead): `classifier.dense.weight [H,H]` +
  `classifier.out_proj.weight [1,H]` + biases
  → CLS hidden → Linear → tanh → Linear → scalar score

The converter must include these weights. Detection: `crispembed.is_reranker`
is set based on presence of `classifier.dense.weight` in the GGUF.

Some rerankers (ms-marco-MiniLM) use `num_labels=1` with no activation,
while others (bge-reranker) use sigmoid/softmax. CrispEmbed returns the raw
logit — the caller decides on thresholding.

## ModernBERT architecture (pre-LN)

ModernBERT (gte-modernbert-base, modernbert-embed-large) uses **pre-LayerNorm**
ordering, which differs from standard BERT's post-LN:

**Post-LN (BERT/XLM-R/MPNet):**
```
attn(input) → residual_add(input) → LN → FFN → residual_add → LN
```

**Pre-LN (ModernBERT):**
```
LN(input) → attn → residual_add(input) → LN → FFN → residual_add
```

Pre-LN has the LayerNorm *before* each sub-layer, with the residual connection
bypassing the norm. This is the same as GPT-2/LLaMA-style normalization.

Detection: `bert.pre_ln` GGUF metadata flag. Combined with:
- GeGLU activation (GELU-gated FFN instead of SwiGLU)
- RoPE (no position embeddings)
- No biases on attention or FFN
- Fused QKV weights

ModernBERT is essentially a bidirectional LLaMA with GELU instead of SiLU.
CrispASR has a reference implementation in `examples/talk-llama/models/modern-bert.cpp`.

### ModernBERT debugging: cos 0.69 → 0.97

Two bugs caused cos=0.69 across 22 layers (1-layer was 0.999):

**Bug 1: Wrong SEP token.** The BPE merge re-loading after tensor init
was calling `load(vocab, merges, eos_id=sep_id, pad_id, suffix_id=unk_id=3, ...)`
instead of `suffix_id=-1`. This made the tokenizer append token 3 (unk)
instead of 50282 (SEP). The wrong token propagated through all 22 layers
of the transformer, compounding the error.

Lesson: when re-initializing a tokenizer after loading merges, preserve
ALL original parameters — don't substitute defaults for parameters that
were carefully set during the first init.

**Bug 2: Separate GELU+MUL vs fused ggml_geglu.** Our code used:
```cpp
up = matmul(fc1_w, cur);     // [inter, T]
gate = matmul(ffn_gate_w, cur); // [inter, T]
up = gelu(up);
ffn = mul(up, gate);
```

llama.cpp uses:
```cpp
up_gate = matmul(ffn_up_gate_w, cur); // [2*inter, T]
ffn = ggml_geglu(up_gate);           // fused: gelu(first_half) * second_half
```

The fused `ggml_geglu` is a single ggml operation that avoids intermediate
rounding between the GELU and multiply. With 22 layers × ~1000 intermediate
dimensions, the accumulated rounding difference is significant for pre-LN
models (where residual connections pass raw values without normalization reset).

Fix: store the original fused `Wi` / `up_gate_proj` weight in the GGUF
and use `ggml_geglu` instead of separate ops. Also use `ggml_swiglu` for
NomicBERT-style SwiGLU.

**Why post-LN models don't have this problem:** In post-LN models (BERT),
LayerNorm after each residual add normalizes the hidden state to unit
variance. This effectively "resets" any accumulated floating-point drift.
In pre-LN models, the raw residual passes directly to the next layer,
allowing small per-layer errors (~0.001) to compound nonlinearly.

**Per-layer theta:** ModernBERT alternates sliding (theta=10000) and global
(theta=160000) attention. For encoding (not generation), sliding window
masking is NOT applied — confirmed by llama.cpp's `build_attn_inp_no_cache()`.

## Head-to-head benchmark: CrispEmbed vs FastEmbed

**MiniLM-L6 (6 layers, 384d)**: CrispEmbed is **9.5x faster** on single text
and **10.8x faster** on batch. This is our best-optimized model: QKV fusion
reduces 3 matmuls to 1 per layer, flash attention replaces 8 separate ops,
and graph caching eliminates rebuild overhead.

**BGE-small (12 layers, 384d)**: FastEmbed is **1.7x faster**. ONNX Runtime's
Level3 graph JIT compilation (operator fusion, layout optimization, cache-aware
scheduling) gives it an edge on 12-layer models. Our per-op execution on CPU
has higher overhead per layer.

**Arctic-M (12 layers, 768d)**: Tied on batch (126 vs 127ms). As hidden size
grows, matmul compute dominates over per-op overhead, equalizing performance.

**Conclusion**: CrispEmbed wins decisively on small models (6 layers) where
per-op overhead matters most. On larger models, ONNX Runtime's graph optimization
closes the gap. GPU (CUDA/Metal) should favor CrispEmbed across all sizes due
to ggml's fused CUDA kernels and flash attention.

## DeBERTa-v2 disentangled attention (full parity)

DeBERTa-v2's attention computes three components, all now implemented:
1. **c2c** (content-to-content): standard Q×K^T
2. **c2p** (content-to-position): Q × K_proj(rel_embd)^T
3. **p2c** (position-to-content): K × Q_proj(rel_embd)^T

### Key implementation details

**Pre-expansion approach**: Rather than gather+matmul at runtime, we pre-expand
the position embeddings on CPU: `P[H, T*T]` where `P[:, i*T+j] = LN(rel_emb[bucket(i-j)+256])`.
Then project through K/Q weights and use batched matmul to compute all scores.

**Critical: HF uses bucket(query-key) for BOTH c2p AND p2c**. This is
counter-intuitive — you'd expect p2c to use bucket(key-query). But HF's
`disentangled_attention_bias` gathers p2c using the same relative position
index, then transposes the result. To achieve this with pre-expansion, we
transpose the T×T grid for p2c: `P_p2c = P.reshape(H,T,T).permute(0,2,1)`.

**Encoder LayerNorm on position embeddings**: HF applies `encoder.LayerNorm`
to `rel_embeddings.weight` BEFORE using them in attention (`get_rel_embedding()`).
This is separate from the post-encoder LayerNorm. Missing this causes ~15%
error in position scores.

**Position projection biases**: HF's `key_proj`/`query_proj` are `nn.Linear`
which include bias. Must add `k_bias` to Pk and `q_bias` to Pq.

**Log-bucket formula** (`make_log_bucket_position`): Uses signed bucket values
centered at `att_span` (= position_buckets = 256). The log denominator is
`log((max_relative_positions - 1) / mid)`, NOT `log((max_pos/2 - 1) / mid)`.

**Attention output reshape**: After V-weighted sum `[hd, T_q, nh]`, must permute
to `[hd, nh, T_q]` BEFORE reshaping to `[H, T]`. Without this permute, head
dimensions get incorrectly interleaved.

**Score scaling**: `1/sqrt(3 * head_dim)` when both c2p and p2c are present
(the 3 = 1 + num_position_attention_types).

### ggml_permute semantics (output-position convention)

`ggml_permute(a, ax0, ax1, ax2, ax3)`: `axes[k]` means "source dimension k
goes to result dimension `axes[k]`". So `permute(a, 0, 2, 1, 3)` on
`[hd, nh, T, B]` gives `[hd, T, nh, B]` (dims 1 and 2 swap).

This is the OPPOSITE of numpy's `transpose` where you specify source→result.

## Rust crate verification

The CrispEmbed Rust crate (`crispembed/`) wraps the C API via `crispembed-sys`
(cmake build.rs). Verified features:
- Dense encode (384d, correct values match Python)
- Batch encode (3 vectors, correct)
- Prefix set/get
- Matryoshka truncation (128d from 384d)
- Bi-encoder reranking (correct ordering)
- Capability queries (has_sparse, has_colbert, is_reranker)

The crate links dynamically (`dylib=crispembed`). Set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to the
build output directory. Static linking would avoid this but requires listing
all ggml dependencies in build.rs.

## BidirLM-Omni: 3D interleaved MRoPE via ggml IMROPE

HF `BidirLMOmniTextRotaryEmbedding.apply_interleaved_mrope` builds a per-token
`freqs_t` of length `head_dim/2` from three position channels `(t, h, w)` and
the configured `mrope_section = [s_t, s_h, s_w]` (default `[24, 20, 20]`):

- Start with `freqs_t = freqs[t]` (channel 0 across the entire vector).
- Replace indices `slice(1, 3*s_h, 3)` with `freqs[h]` at those indices.
- Replace indices `slice(2, 3*s_w, 3)` with `freqs[w]` at those indices.
- Anything beyond `3*s_h` (resp. `3*s_w`) stays in the t-channel.

For `[24, 20, 20]` and `head_dim=128` (so 64 cos/sin pairs), this produces:
T at positions 0, 3, …, 60, 63; H at 1, 4, …, 58; W at 2, 5, …, 59; T at 61–63
beyond the H/W slice ends.

ggml's `GGML_ROPE_TYPE_IMROPE` takes 4-channel positions `(t, h, w, e)` and
sections `[s_t, s_h, s_w, s_e]`. Its sector check is:

- `sector%3==0 && sector < 3*s_t` → `theta_t`
- `sector%3==1 && sector < 3*s_h` → `theta_h`
- `sector%3==2 && sector < 3*s_w` → `theta_w`
- otherwise → `theta_e`

For sections `[24, 20, 20, 0]` ggml routes sectors 61 and 62 to `theta_e`,
whereas HF leaves them on the T channel. The fix is to **pin `pos_e = pos_t`
per-token**: with that, `theta_e == theta_t` numerically at every sector and
the ggml IMROPE output matches HF byte-for-byte. The position tensor passed
to `ggml_rope_multi` therefore has shape `(4*T,)` laid out as
`[pos_t, pos_h, pos_w, pos_t]` (the tail mirrors the head).

For text-only inputs the three channels are all equal, so MRoPE collapses to
plain NEOX RoPE — `decoder_embed.cpp` keeps using `ggml_rope_ext` on the
text-only path to stay bit-identical with the pre-Phase-3 baseline tests.

## BidirLM-Omni: decoder scheduler init was missing

Before Phase 3 the decoder branch in `crispembed_init` never created a
`ggml_backend_sched` or sized `compute_meta` — those were only set up by
`load_model()` on the encoder branch. `decoder_encode_tokens` checks
`(sched != nullptr && compute_meta != nullptr)` and falls back to direct
`ggml_graph_compute` when either is null, so BidirLM-Omni text and audio
were silently running CPU-only on Metal builds.

Fix: in the decoder branch, after `load_decoder_model`, allocate

```cpp
const int graph_nodes = std::max(4096, ctx->dec->n_layer * 50 + 256);
ctx->sched = ggml_backend_sched_new(...);
ctx->compute_meta.resize(ggml_tensor_overhead() * graph_nodes
                       + ggml_graph_overhead_custom(graph_nodes, false));
```

The `4096` floor is important: with image-conditioned text the graph adds an
input mask + patch (2 ops), per-layer DeepStack adds (n_ds ops), and
`ggml_rope_multi` instead of `ggml_rope_ext` (no node-count delta but extra
per-tensor metadata). 28 layers × ~50 ops ≈ 1400 still fits, but the floor
keeps headroom for future architectural growth and avoids surprising
allocation failures. Verify with `--save-baseline` / `--compare-baseline` in
`tests/benchmark_bidirlm.py` — text-only cosine should remain ≥ 0.99999
against the baseline taken before this change.

## BidirLM-Omni: parity reference dtype matters

When validating a quantized GGUF against a HuggingFace reference, the
**reference dtype** is part of the comparison and silently shifts the
upper bound. BidirLM-Omni-2.5B-Embedding ships its `model.safetensors`
in bf16 — that's the dtype the model was trained in. Loading it into
torch and calling `.to(torch.float32)` doesn't reconstruct any
pre-bf16 information; it just zero-pads the mantissa. So a cosine of
~0.94 vs HF fp32 is two distinct quantization steps stacked (bf16
trained → q4_k storage, then bf16 → fp32 upcast for the reference),
not "the q4_k is broken."

The fix in `tests/test_bidirlm_image_text.py`: the reference dtype is
a `--ref-dtype` flag, defaulting to bf16. Match the trained dtype.

## BidirLM-Omni: q4_k quantization cosine ceiling

Empirically, **q4_k vs HF bf16 settles at ~0.94 cosine** for the 2.5B
embedding variant, on both text-only (`tests/test_bidirlm_text.py`)
and image+text (`tests/test_bidirlm_image_text.py` /
`tests/test_bidirlm_image_text_lite.py`). That's the q4_k *intrinsic*
cosine — not a Phase 3 multimodal-injection bug.

The README's "cosine ≥ 0.99999" gate is for **graph regressions**
(CrispEmbed-q4_k vs a saved CrispEmbed-q4_k baseline from before a
code change); it doesn't measure CrispEmbed-vs-HF. To get ≥ 0.99
cosine vs HF bf16 you need q8_0 or higher precision.

Concretely measured (April 2026, q4_k against HF bf16 on /tmp/cat.jpg):

| path | cosine |
|---|---|
| text-only (`encode("Hello world")`) | 0.93–0.95 |
| multimodal (`encode_with_image_ids`) | 0.94 |

When debugging Phase 3 parity, run *both* test paths against the same
quant — if the multimodal cosine matches the text-only cosine for the
same prompts (modulo image content), the multimodal graph is fine and
the gap is the quant's intrinsic precision floor. If multimodal is
lower than text-only, that's a Phase 3 bug.

## BidirLM-Omni: image preprocessor parity is governed by mean/std, not the JPEG decoder

When porting HF Qwen2VLImageProcessorFast to C++ for `image_preprocess.cpp`,
the initial cosine vs HF was 0.97 — well below the ≥0.99 target. The
intuition was "stb_image's JPEG decoder differs from PIL/libjpeg-turbo by
a few LSBs, that propagates through the bicubic resize." That was wrong:

- Adding a PIL-decoded-RGB pass-through (`crispembed_preprocess_image_rgb`,
  skipping stb's JPEG decode entirely) moved cosine from 0.987 to 0.987.
- Switching `bicubic_resize_u8_to_f32` to round-clamp to integer (mimicking
  torchvision's uint8 round-trip on `tvF.resize(uint8, antialias=True)`)
  also moved cosine from 0.987 to 0.987.

The actual cause was the `image_preproc::config` defaults using OpenAI CLIP
mean/std `[0.481, 0.458, 0.408]` / `[0.269, 0.261, 0.276]`, while
**BidirLM-Omni's `preprocessor_config.json` specifies `mean = std = [0.5,
0.5, 0.5]`** (the SimVL / Qwen2-VL convention that maps `[0,1]` → `[-1,1]`).
Every normalized pixel value was off by a roughly-constant linear transform,
which has *high* flat cosine (0.987) but huge max-abs-diff (1.19 in
normalized space). The numbers had a strong mean-shift, which cosine
similarity is largely insensitive to until rescaled by std.

After fixing the defaults: pixel_values cosine 0.987 → 0.999989,
encode_image embedding cosine 0.970 → 0.999984. Sub-1e-5 residual is
sub-pixel torchvision-uint8 bicubic kernel weight quantization (PyTorch
uses int16 weights for the uint8 AA path; we use float weights).

`min_pixels` and `max_pixels` were also wrong for BidirLM-Omni (the
defaults from Qwen2-VL: 56² and 14²·4·1280; BidirLM uses 256² and 1024²
per the preprocessor config). For our test image these happened to land
on the same `smart_resize` output, but a different aspect ratio could
have produced a different grid_thw.

Lesson: when matching a model's preprocessor, read the actual
`preprocessor_config.json` from the HF repo. Don't assume CLIP defaults.
The converter (`models/convert-decoder-embed-to-gguf.py`) now writes
`bidirlm.vision.image_mean / image_std / min_pixels / max_pixels` into
the GGUF so future model variants can be picked up without guessing.

## BidirLM-Omni: image-embed splice via mask + add

HF does `inputs_embeds = inputs_embeds.masked_scatter(image_mask, image_embeds)`
to replace token-embed rows at every `image_token_id` placeholder with vision
tower output. ggml has no native `masked_scatter`, so `decoder_embed.cpp`
emulates it with two host-prepared inputs:

- `in_keep_mask` shape `(1, T)` — 1.0 at text positions, 0.0 at image positions.
- `in_patch` shape `(H, T)` — `image_embeds[k]` row at the k-th image position,
  zeros at text positions.

```
cur = ggml_get_rows(token_embd, ids_t)
cur = ggml_mul(cur, in_keep_mask)   // zero out image-position rows
cur = ggml_add(cur, in_patch)       // splice image_embeds in at those rows
```

The `(1, T) * (H, T)` mul broadcasts the leading dim over H — same trick the
vision tower uses for the 4-corner pos-embed gather. DeepStack adds use the
same `(H, T)` patch shape, one per layer for the first `n_deepstack` layers,
zero everywhere except at image positions; `cur = ggml_add(cur, ds_patches[il])`
after each layer's residual+ffn output mirrors HF's `_deepstack_process`.

## Distribution: install(EXPORT) + ggml SHARED don't compose

When `crispembed-shared` is a SHARED library that PRIVATEly links a SHARED
ggml backend (`ggml-cpu`, `ggml-base`, …), `install(TARGETS crispembed-shared
EXPORT crispembed-targets)` errors with:

> install(EXPORT "crispembed-targets" …) includes target "crispembed-shared"
> which requires target "ggml-cpu" that is not in any export set.

The reason: even for PRIVATE link deps of a SHARED lib, CMake records them
as `IMPORTED_LINK_DEPENDENT_LIBRARIES` so downstream consumers know what
runtime SO names the .so will dlopen. install(EXPORT) demands those deps
either be in some export set or be system-IMPORTED.

Two viable workarounds:

1. **Hand-rolled IMPORTED target** (what CrispEmbed does, mirroring
   CrispASR): skip `install(EXPORT)` entirely. The `crispembed-config.cmake.in`
   uses `find_library(crispembed_LIBRARY crispembed HINTS …)` plus
   `add_library(crispembed::crispembed UNKNOWN IMPORTED)` to manufacture
   the IMPORTED target at config time. Runtime resolution of `libggml*.so`
   siblings is handled entirely by the .so's RPATH (`$ORIGIN` /
   `@loader_path`), not by the consumer's link line.
2. **Add ggml to the same EXPORT** via `set_target_properties(ggml*
   PROPERTIES EXPORT_NAME …)` and put ggml's install in your export.
   More invasive and requires patching the ggml submodule.

(1) is the right choice when the .so is the only thing the user sees and
ggml is implementation detail; (2) is right when you want consumers to be
able to `find_package(ggml)` separately.

## Distribution: relocatable pkg-config via ${pcfiledir}

`@CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX@` in a `.pc.in` is bound at configure time, not
install time. A user who runs `cmake --install build --prefix /opt/foo`
gets a `.pc` file with `prefix=/usr/local` (the configure default), and
`pkg-config --libs crispembed` returns wrong paths.

The fix is the **relocatable** pattern — set `prefix` from the .pc file's
own location:

```pc
prefix=${pcfiledir}/../..
libdir=${prefix}/lib
```

Since the .pc lives at `<prefix>/lib/pkgconfig/crispembed.pc`, going
`../..` from there is the prefix dir, no matter where the user dropped it.
Verified across `cmake --install --prefix /tmp/...`, tarball extraction
into `/opt/foo`, and the standard `/usr/local`.

## Distribution: forward-declared structs need typedefs for C consumers

`crispembed.h` had `struct crispembed_context;` plus function signatures
like `crispembed_context * ctx`. In C++ the struct name lives in the type
namespace so this compiles; in **C** the caller has to write
`struct crispembed_context *` everywhere. Adding

```c
typedef struct crispembed_context crispembed_context;
typedef struct crispembed_hparams { … } crispembed_hparams;
```

(forward-decl style for opaque types, full definition for value types) was
caught by the install verification test — a plain-C consumer of the
freshly `cmake --install`-ed header. The build directory consumers
(crispembed-cli, crispembed-server) didn't catch it because they're
compiled as C++.

## CNN forward path for face models (Phase 8)

### Available ggml ops for CNN
- `ggml_conv_2d(a, b, s0, s1, p0, p1, d0, d1)` — standard 2D conv
- `ggml_conv_2d_dw(a, b, ...)` — depthwise 2D conv
- `ggml_pool_2d(a, op, k0, k1, s0, s1, p0, p1)` — average/max pool
- `ggml_relu`, `ggml_leaky_relu(a, slope, inplace)` — activations
- No `ggml_prelu` — implement as: `relu(x) + slope * (x - relu(x))`
  where slope is a learned [C, 1, 1] tensor per channel

### BatchNorm folding
At inference time, BN is folded into the preceding Conv:
```
w_new = w * gamma / sqrt(var + eps)
b_new = (b - mean) * gamma / sqrt(var + eps) + beta
```
This eliminates all BN tensors from the forward pass.

### Conv2d output layout in ggml
`ggml_conv_2d` output: `[OW, OH, OC]` — width-first (ne[0]=OW).
To match HF's `[OC, OH, OW]` (channel-first): `permute(2, 1, 0)`.
This matters for position embeddings in ViT but NOT for CNNs
(CNNs are translation-equivariant — spatial order preserved naturally).

### SFace architecture (MobileFaceNet)
27 Conv layers (14 depthwise separable blocks), PReLU activation,
final GDC pool → FC(50176→128). 128-D L2-normalized embedding.
Input: 112×112 aligned face crop.

### SCRFD architecture (ResNet-50 + FPN)
58 Conv layers, ReLU activation, FPN with 3 scales (stride 8/16/32).
9 output heads: 3 × (confidence [N,1], bbox [N,4], landmarks [N,10]).
Dynamic input size (typically 640×640).
Needs NMS post-processing.

### AuraFace architecture (ResNet-100)
103 Conv layers, PReLU, 49 residual Add connections.
512-D ArcFace-compatible embedding. Apache 2.0.

### CrispASR CNN reference
CrispASR has CNN forward paths for marblenet (depthwise 1D conv),
wav2vec2 (grouped conv), and others. Same ggml ops, similar patterns.
Patches at tools/upstream-prs/ may be needed for CUDA conv2d.

### YuNet ggml Transpose behavior (2D vs 3D tensors)
The `replay_graph()` Transpose op does a real 2D transpose for tensors
where `ggml_n_dims == 2` (i.e., last dimension is 1). YuNet's cls/obj
outputs have 1 channel and thus get physically transposed, while bbox/kps
with 4/10 channels remain in the original ggml layout. This requires
different spatial indexing for each:
- cls/obj (1 channel, transposed): `data[row + col * grid_h]`
- bbox/kps (multi-channel, passthrough): `data[col + row * grid_w + chan * plane]`

## ViT / CLIP parity: patch ordering bug (FIXED — cos 0.8 → 1.0)

**Previously**: CLIP and SigLIP vision achieved cos ≈ 0.8 vs HuggingFace.
This was incorrectly attributed to FP32 matmul accumulation order differences.

**Actual root cause (fixed 2026-06-06)**: The `ggml_permute(2,1,0)` used to
reshape `[OW, OH, D]` → `[D, OH, OW]` produced column-major spatial ordering
when flattened to `[D, T]`: `t = oh + ow*OH`. But HuggingFace's `flatten(2)`
gives row-major: `t = oh*OW + ow`. Every patch beyond (0,0) got the wrong
position embedding, causing systematic error at the very first layer that
compounded through all 12 layers.

**Fix**: `ggml_permute(1,2,0,3)` produces `[D, OW, OH]` with `ne[0]=D,
ne[1]=OW, ne[2]=OH`. When flattened to `[D, T]`, patches follow row-major
`t = ow + oh*OW = oh*OW + ow`, matching HF.

**Result**: Per-layer cos = 1.000000 across all 12 layers. Final embedding
cos = 0.9998 vs HuggingFace (SigLIP-base-384).

**Lesson**: Always verify data layout empirically, especially with
`ggml_permute` where the axis semantics ("old dim N goes to new position
axN") differ from numpy/PyTorch conventions. The first few values matched
(patch 0 is at position 0 in both orderings) which masked the bug.

### SigLIP attention pooling head: missing residual

HF's `SiglipMultiheadAttentionPoolingHead` computes:
```
residual = probe + attention(probe, x_cat, x_cat)
output = residual + MLP(LayerNorm(residual))
```

The final `residual +` was initially missing in our implementation,
producing cos=0.17 vs HF. After fix: cos=0.74 (same precision ceiling
as other ViT models).

## Handwritten Math OCR (HMER + BTTR)

### Image polarity auto-detection

Both HMER and BTTR expect white-on-black input (ink = 1.0, background = 0.0).
Real-world images are typically black-on-white. Both implementations auto-detect
by checking the mean pixel value: if mean > 0.5, the image is inverted
(`pixel = 1.0 - pixel`). This avoids requiring the user to preprocess images.

### BTTR architecture (DenseNet + Transformer decoder)

BTTR (Bidirectionally Trained Transformer, ICDAR 2021) uses:
- DenseNet encoder (growth=24, 16 layers × 3 blocks, 1-channel grayscale)
- Conv 1×1 projection to d=256
- 2D sinusoidal position encoding (added to encoder features)
- Standard nn.TransformerDecoder (3 layers, 8 heads, d=256, FFN=1024)
- Post-LayerNorm, fused QKV weights preserved from PyTorch
- 113 LaTeX tokens, 6.5M params

Key implementation details:
- BN is folded into Conv at convert time (same as face models)
- Fused QKV weights: kept as-is, split via ggml_view_2d in the decoder
- Decoder uses causal mask for autoregressive generation
- Cross-attention: Q from decoder, K/V from encoder features

### HMER architecture (DenseNet-121 + GRU attention)

HMER uses a coverage-based GRU attention decoder (not Transformer):
- DenseNet-121 encoder (growth=32, 3 blocks of [6, 12, 24] layers)
- 2-channel input: grayscale + mask (coverage mechanism)
- GRU decoder with attention (not self-attention — attends to encoder features)
- Coverage vector prevents the decoder from re-attending to the same regions
- 112 LaTeX tokens, 6.8M params

### Dequantization for CNN inference

When running quantized HMER/BTTR models (Q4_K/Q8_0), the DenseNet Conv2D
kernels need dequantization because `ggml_conv_2d` only supports F32/F16
weights. Both implementations call `ggml_backend_tensor_get` to read
quantized data into a CPU buffer, then use `ggml_quantize.h` functions
to dequantize to F32 before building the conv2d graph node.

**Important**: ggml only supports `quantized → F32` cast (in `ggml_compute_forward_dup`).
Direct `Q8_0 → F16` cast triggers a fatal error. Always dequant to F32 first,
then cast F32 → F16 as a separate step.

### Conv weight reshape for GGUF

PyTorch Conv2D stores weights as [out_ch, in_ch, kh, kw] (4D). GGUF
requires 2D tensors for quantization. The converter flattens to
[out_ch, in_ch * kh * kw] for storage. At load time, the C++ code
reshapes back to the 4D layout expected by `ggml_conv_2d`.

**Pitfalls in the 2D→4D reshape** (resolved 2026-06-06):

1. **`ggml_n_dims()` collapses trailing 1s**: A 4D weight `[3,3,1,1]`
   (OC=1, IC=1) reports `ndims=2`, same as a genuinely flattened 2D weight.
   Fix: validate `KW*KH*IC*OC == nelements` before applying reshape.

2. **Depthwise conv IC detection**: DW weights are `[OC, 1*KH*KW]` when
   flattened. Using input channels as IC gives `kernel_area = 9/16 = 0`.
   Fix: parse the group attr from the graph node `[s1p1g16]` BEFORE
   the reshape. When `group > 1`, set IC=1.

3. **OC=1 weights report ndims=1**: Flattened `[IC*KH*KW, 1]` has
   `ne[1]=1`, so `ggml_n_dims = 1`. Use `ndims <= 2` to catch these.

### YuNet raw tensor cos vs ONNX — layout difference, not a bug

Raw tensor cos between C++ replay_graph and ONNX reference is 0.35-0.85
for bbox/kps outputs. This is NOT a parity issue — the Transpose and
Reshape handlers in replay_graph don't rearrange memory for 3D+ tensors
(passthrough). The result is planar `[C, H, W]` layout in ggml vs
interleaved `[H*W, C]` in ONNX. The YuNet decode loop uses matching
indexing: `col + row*grid_w + chan*plane` for the planar layout.

Verified: decoded detection coordinates match OpenCV FaceDetectorYN to
sub-pixel accuracy (< 0.5px diff) on both single-face and multi-face
images. The cls tensors (1 channel) show cos=0.985-0.992 because layout
is irrelevant for single-channel data.

## PosFormer port — encoder/decoder debugging

### 2D sinusoidal positional encoding: sin/cos MUST share frequency

PyTorch `ImgPosEnc` computes inv_freq with `arange(0, half_d, 2)` → 64 values.
Each sin/cos pair uses the SAME frequency: `sin(x * f_i), cos(x * f_i)`.

The initial C++ used different freq indices for sin vs cos:
```cpp
enc[2*i]     += sinf(x_norm * inv_freq[2*i]);     // freq 2i
enc[2*i + 1] += cosf(x_norm * inv_freq[2*i + 1]); // freq 2i+1 ← WRONG
```
Fix: both must use `inv_freq[i]` (or `inv_freq[2*i]` from a 128-element array).
Symptom: encoder cosine dropped to 0.58.

### Operation ordering: pos_enc THEN LayerNorm (not reversed)

PyTorch encoder does: `feature_proj → rearrange → pos_enc_2d → LayerNorm`.
The C++ initially did: `feature_proj → rearrange → LayerNorm → pos_enc_2d`.
LayerNorm normalizes the combined feature+pos signal; applying it before
pos encoding means the positional encoding is un-normalized.

### No ReLU after feature projection

PyTorch's `self.feature_proj = nn.Conv2d(...)` has no activation. The C++
had a spurious `relu_ip()` that clipped half the signal.

### Missing decoder input LayerNorm (the biggest bug)

PyTorch decoder does:
```python
tgt = self.word_embed(tgt)  # nn.Sequential(Embedding, LayerNorm)
tgt = self.pos_enc(tgt)     # sinusoidal pos encoding
tgt = self.norm(tgt)        # ← SECOND LayerNorm, was missing in C++
```

This `decoder.norm` was not in the GGUF converter OR the C++ inference.
Symptom: layer 0 self-attention output had cos=0.868 at step 0 (should
be 1.0). After adding `dec.input_norm` to converter and C++ decoder:
cos=1.000000 at every step, max_diff < 0.00001.

**Lesson**: never attribute divergence to "FP accumulation." If cosine is
below 0.999 at step 0, there is a real bug. Trace layer-by-layer with
intermediate dumps (after SA, after CA, after FFN) to find it.

### ARM (Attention Refinement Module) incremental mode is correct

The incremental ARM with per-ARM-instance accumulators matches the PyTorch
batch cumsum exactly, IF the encoder and decoder embedding are correct.
The ARM was never the bug — the divergence came entirely from the four
encoder/decoder bugs listed above.

### Bi-directional beam search vs greedy

PosFormer's published 62.7% uses bi-directional beam search (L2R + R2L
decode, cross-rate, pick best). The C++ implements L2R greedy only. Direct
comparison must use the PyTorch decoder.forward() in a manual greedy loop,
NOT the model.beam_search() which includes the bi-directional scoring.

### Kaggle kernel patterns — MUST follow established conventions

1. **Always clone CrispASR and import kaggle_harness** — never reimplement
   token resolution, progress logging, or GPU detection. The harness has
   been debugged across 15+ kernels.
2. **kernel-metadata.json uses string "true"** not boolean true.
3. **P100 (sm_60) + PyTorch**: Kaggle's pre-installed PyTorch (CUDA 12.x)
   dropped sm_60 support. Fix: `pip install torch --index-url .../cu118`
   which still supports P100 GPU. Do NOT fall back to CPU.
4. **Dataset mount path**: Kaggle mounts `chr1str/crispasr-hf-token` at
   `/kaggle/input/datasets/chr1str/crispasr-hf-token/`, NOT at
   `/kaggle/input/crispasr-hf-token/`. The harness was patched to scan
   both paths.
5. **Kaggle Secrets API**: intermittently returns ConnectionError. The
   dataset file fallback is the reliable path.
6. **Validation speed**: PosFormer's `approximate_joint_search` uses
   bi-directional beam search (beam_size=10) on all 986 test images.
   This takes 30-60 min per validation step. Override with greedy
   beam_size=1 for ~10x faster validation during training.
7. **Heartbeat**: wrap `trainer.fit()` in `kh.build_heartbeat("train")`
   so Kaggle logs show the run is alive during long operations.
8. **W&B run resume**: using a fixed `id=` with `resume="allow"` lets
   multi-session training continue the same W&B run. But if you kill
   and restart, the charts mix old+new data. Change the run ID for
   a clean restart.
9. **Vocabulary ordering is critical**: PosFormer uses an alphabetical
   dictionary (!, (, ), +, ...). Building vocab from `Counter.most_common()`
   sorts by frequency ({, }, 1, 2, ...), scrambling 110/113 token indices.
   The model trains "successfully" (internal metrics look fine) but the
   checkpoint is completely unusable with the original dictionary, GGUF
   converter, or C++ inference. ALWAYS use the canonical dictionary.txt.
10. **OOV tokens**: 14 CROHME captions contain `'` (apostrophe) which is
    not in PosFormer's 110-token dictionary. Filter these before training
    or the DataLoader crashes with KeyError.
11. **Cosine warm restarts are dangerous**: CosineAnnealingWarmRestarts
    (T_0=30) reset LR from 0.008→0.08 at epoch 94, crashing val_ExpRate
    from 57% to 38%. The model briefly recovered to 60.1% then fell
    again. Plain CosineAnnealingLR (no restarts) is safer. The 60.1%
    peak was lost because the checkpoint was overwritten.
12. **Never delete HF checkpoints hastily**: HuggingFace has git history
    — deleted files can be recovered via `hf_hub_download(revision=SHA)`.
    But always back up to /mnt/storage first before deleting.
13. **Dataset license verification**: figshare uploads can have wrong
    licenses (user picks any license, no verification). CROHME+HME100K
    on figshare claims CC BY 4.0 but the original datasets are NC/
    proprietary. Always check the original source, not re-uploads.
14. **UniMER dataset (Apache 2.0)**: wanderkid/UniMER_Dataset on HF has
    978K printed math images (ArXiv+Pix2tex) under Apache 2.0. The
    CROHME and HME100K subsets are excluded from this license ("requires
    manual download for copyright"). Best commercial data source found.
15. **MathWriting augmentation works**: Adding 2000 MathWriting samples
    (filtered to v1 110-token vocab from deepcopy/MathWriting-human on HF)
    to CROHME training broke the 59.3% ceiling → 60.5% verified.
    47% of MathWriting is compatible with v1 vocab (~109K out of 230K).
16. **Beam=10 bi-directional doesn't help our model**: 60.3% beam=10 vs
    60.5% beam=1 — beam search actually hurts by 0.2%. The R2L path
    sometimes picks worse hypotheses that beat correct L2R in cross-scoring.
    This differs from SJTU's published model where beam=10 added ~6 points.
17. **ReduceLROnPlateau is the key to peaks**: The best val_ExpRate always
    came right after an LR drop (0.08→0.005 gave 57%, 0.005→0.00125 gave
    62%). Manual LR patching in checkpoint files works when callbacks fail.
18. **Use deepcopy/MathWriting-human for MathWriting data**: Pre-rasterized
    JPG images + LaTeX strings on HuggingFace. Much faster than downloading
    and parsing 230K InkML files from Google Storage.

## NomicBERT v2-moe: hidden biases and GPT2 config

NomicBERT extends `GPT2Config`, so standard attribute names are missing:
`intermediate_size` → `n_inner`, `hidden_act` → missing (default GELU).
Patch onto config before accessing.

**Critical**: NomicBERT v1.5 has NO Wqkv/out_proj biases, but v2-moe
DOES have them (`Wqkv.bias [2304]`, `out_proj.bias [768]`). The original
converter assumed "no bias" based on v1.5 — this caused cos ≈ 0.955 parity
(consistent across all texts, easily mistaken for a precision issue rather
than a missing-data bug). Always check `bias is not None` dynamically
rather than hardcoding assumptions from one model variant.

Diagnosis approach: tensor diff showed all 148 weights bit-exact (0.0),
proving the bug was runtime-only. Layer-by-layer dump (`CRISPEMBED_DUMP_LAYERS`)
showed divergence starting at the attention output (before residual/LN),
which pointed to QKV projection. Manual `x @ W.T` matched HF weights
but not `Wqkv(x)` — the missing bias term.

## MoE encoder: ggml_mul_mat_id layout

For `ggml_mul_mat_id(A, B, ids)`:
- A shape `[ne0, ne1, n_experts]`, B shape `[ne0, K, T]`, ids `[K, T]`
- Result: `[ne1, K, T]` — transposes A along ne0/ne1 (same as mul_mat)
- For expert fc2 (down projection): HF stores `w2 [n_exp*inter, hidden]`,
  used as `act_out @ w2` (NO transpose). For ggml we need ne0=inter,
  ne1=hidden → numpy `[n_exp, hidden, inter]` → converter does
  `.permute(0, 2, 1)` on the `[n_exp, inter, hidden]` reshape.

## GELU variants matter for NomicBERT

NomicBERT uses `nn.GELU(approximate='none')` (exact erf-based), not the
tanh approximation. ggml provides both: `ggml_gelu()` (tanh approx) and
`ggml_gelu_erf()` (exact). Per-element error is ~1e-4 but compounds over
12 layers. Use `ggml_gelu_erf` for NomicBERT (both MoE expert and dense
FFN layers). Standard BERT typically uses `gelu_new` (tanh approx).

## General OCR: DBNet + TrOCR

### ConvTranspose2d weight layout differs from Conv2d
PyTorch Conv2d: `(OC, IC, KH, KW)` → flattened `(OC, IC*KH*KW)`.
PyTorch ConvTranspose2d: `(IC, OC, KH, KW)` → flattened `(IC, OC*KH*KW)`.

ggml `conv_transpose_2d_p0` expects kernel `[KW, KH, OC, IC]` — note IC
and OC are swapped vs regular `conv_2d` kernel `[KW, KH, IC, OC]`.
Needed a separate `prep_deconv_weight()` that reshapes to `(KW, KH, OC, IC)`.

### ODR violations with common struct names
`struct dec_layer` was defined in both `math_ocr.cpp` (30 pointer fields,
240 bytes) and `decoder_embed_internal.h` (18 pointer fields, 144 bytes).
In the test binary (linking only math_ocr), the correct 240-byte version
was used. In the CLI binary (linking everything), the 144-byte version won,
causing heap-buffer-overflow when math_ocr tried to write 30 fields into
18-field-sized allocations.

Fix: namespace-prefix struct names (`math_ocr_dec_layer`). ASAN caught this
immediately — always test with the full binary, not just individual TU tests.

### XLM-R / SentencePiece fairseq vocab offset
TrOCR uses XLMRobertaTokenizer which adds a fairseq offset to SentencePiece
token IDs. Raw `SentencePiece.id_to_piece(43778)` returns the wrong string.
Must use HF `AutoTokenizer.convert_ids_to_tokens(43778)` to get correct
mapping. Also: use `convert_ids_to_tokens()` (not `decode()`) to preserve
the `▁` word boundary markers for proper space reconstruction.

### DBNet FPNC (FPN-Cat) architecture
MMOCR's FPNC is NOT standard FPN. Standard FPN: lateral (1×1) → top-down →
smooth (3×3), all at 256ch. FPNC: lateral (1×1, 256ch) → top-down → smooth
(3×3, **64ch**), then concatenate all 4 levels (4×64=256ch). No output conv.
The smooth conv reduces channels, not the lateral.

### ggml_interpolate replaces ggml_upscale_ext
`ggml_upscale_ext` is deprecated. Use `ggml_interpolate(ctx, a, ne0, ne1,
ne2, ne3, mode)` with `GGML_SCALE_MODE_BILINEAR` for FPN upsampling.
Nearest-neighbor vs bilinear makes a visible difference in detection parity
(cos_min drops from 1.0 to 0.0 with nearest on some rows).

## Quantizer skips 3D tensors

`tools/quantize.cpp` line 172 skips tensors with ndims > 2 ("skipping N-D
tensor (conv2d)"). This was added for face model conv kernels (4D) but
also catches MoE expert weights (3D: `[n_exp, dim1, dim2]`). For
nomic-v2-moe, this means expert weights stay F32 in all quants, limiting
Q8_0 compression to 1.6x instead of potential ~3x. Fix: quantize 3D
tensors by iterating over the outermost dimension.

## Qwen2.5-VL: KV cache for VLM generation

### Prefill K/V extraction pattern

The prefill forward pass computes all prompt tokens at once. To extract
per-layer K/V for caching, add output tensors **after mRoPE but before
GQA repeat**: the K/V at shape (head_dim, n_kv_heads, n_tokens) is what
goes into the cache. GQA repeat is reapplied in each decode step.

```cpp
// In prefill graph, after RoPE:
K_flat = ggml_reshape_2d(g, ggml_cont(g, K), kv_dim, n_tokens);
ggml_set_name(K_flat, "k_out_0");
ggml_set_output(K_flat);
```

### Decode step graph: single token + cache concat

The decode step takes one token embedding + cached K/V as inputs.
K/V cache tensors are 2D (kv_dim, n_kv) passed as graph inputs,
reshaped to 3D, concatenated with the new single-token K/V on dim 2,
then GQA-repeated for attention.

No causal mask needed — a single query token always attends to all
cached KV tokens (it's always the latest position).

### Token embedding lookup for quantized models

During decode, embed_tokens may be quantized (Q8_0/Q4_K). Can't just
index into the data directly. Solution: build a mini ggml graph with
`ggml_get_rows(embed_tokens, [token_id])` to handle dequantization.

### KV cache memory budget

36 layers × 2 (K+V) × kv_dim(256) × n_tokens × 4 bytes.
For 500 prompt tokens: 36 × 2 × 256 × 500 × 4 = 36 MB.
For 2000 tokens: 144 MB. Well within budget.

## Qwen2.5-VL: BPE tokenizer from GGUF

### Standard ggml tokenizer keys

Write to GGUF: `tokenizer.ggml.tokens` (string array), 
`tokenizer.ggml.merges` (string array), `tokenizer.ggml.model` = "gpt2",
`tokenizer.ggml.type` = 1 (BPE).

Load in C++: read arrays from GGUF metadata, pass to `BPETokenizer.load()`.

### GPT-2 byte-level decode

BPE tokens are unicode codepoints, not raw bytes. Decode: concatenate
token strings, then reverse the `bytes_to_unicode()` mapping. The table
maps printable ASCII + Latin-1 to themselves, and remaining bytes to
codepoints 256+. Build the inverse table once at init.

### Chat template in C++

Hardcode special token IDs (im_start=151644, system=8948, user=872,
assistant=77091, etc.) and use the BPE tokenizer for the user prompt
text only. This avoids needing a Jinja template engine in C++.

## Qwen2.5-VL: ggml_set_output memory impact

Marking N intermediate tensors as output prevents ggml's graph allocator
from reusing their memory. For 32 ViT + 36 LLM layers, this adds ~500 MB
of pinned memory — enough to OOM on 8 GB machines.

Fix: only set_output when diff comparison is active (`ctx.diff_ref_path`
is non-empty). Logits tensor always needs set_output.

## Kaggle: always use the full harness

Never simplify or inline the CrispASR kaggle_harness.py. It has:
- `kh.build_heartbeat()` — prevents Kaggle killing long ops (uploads)
- `kh.resolve_hf_token()` — 3-tier auth (env → Secret → dataset file)
- `kh.step()` — JSONL progress to /kaggle/working + HF mirror
- `kh.install_build_toolchain()` — ninja + ccache + mold

Bundle `kaggle_harness.py` in the push directory as fallback.
Use `chr1s4/crispasr-hf-token` dataset (chr1s4's own, not chr1str's).
Don't `pip install torch` (pre-installed, 2 GB download wastes time/OOMs).
## LFM2 backbone: causal → bidirectional (GLiNER NER port)

Porting the LFM2.5 backbone from CrispASR (causal audio model) to
CrispEmbed (bidirectional NER encoder) required exactly two changes:

1. **Attention mask**: causal `(j <= i) ? 0 : -inf` → pass `nullptr`
   to `ggml_flash_attn_ext` for full bidirectional attention.
2. **Conv padding**: left-pad `pad=K-1` → center-pad `pad=(K-1)/2`
   for symmetric (bidirectional) convolutions.

Everything else (RMSNorm, SwiGLU FFN, RoPE, GQA, ShortConv gating)
is identical. The layer_types string `"ccaccaccacacacac"` is the same
pattern for both the 1.5B audio and 350M NER models.

## GLiNER layer fusion: sigmoid not softmax

GLiNER's `LayersFuser` uses **sigmoid** gates (independent per-layer),
NOT softmax (competing across layers). The squeeze-and-excitation
pattern is: squeeze(hidden→1) per layer → mean over tokens → W1→ReLU→W2
→ **sigmoid** → element-wise multiply each layer → sum → output_projection.

Using softmax instead produced cos=0.65 vs reference. Sigmoid gives
cos=1.000000.

## GLiNER pipeline: word-level pooling before BiLSTM

GLiNER's `subtoken_pooling="first"` means: after the backbone + layer
fusion, take the first BPE subtoken of each word to get word-level
representations, THEN run the BiLSTM on word-level only. The entity
type reps (at `<<ENT>>` positions) are extracted from the fused
token-level output BEFORE the BiLSTM.

Running the BiLSTM on the full token sequence (including label prefix
tokens) produces cos=-0.96 vs reference. Word-level gives cos=1.000000.

## GLiNER tokenization: regex word splitter

GLiNER's `WhitespaceTokenSplitter` uses regex `r"\w+(?:[-_]\w+)*|\S"`,
NOT simple whitespace splitting. This separates punctuation from words:
"Cupertino," → ["Cupertino", ","]. Simple whitespace splitting glues
punctuation to the word, causing entity span mismatches.

## GLiNER input format

The input sequence is: `BOS <<ENT>> label1 <<ENT>> label2 ... <<SEP>> text EOS`.
Note: `<<ENT>>` before each label (not `<<SEP>>` between), single
`<<SEP>>` after all labels, BOS at start, EOS at end.

## ggml_conv_1d_dw requires F16 kernel weights

`ggml_conv_1d_dw` internally uses `ggml_im2col` which asserts
`src0->type == GGML_TYPE_F16`. When model weights are F32, cast
the conv kernel to F16 before passing to `ggml_conv_1d_dw`:
`ggml_cast(ctx, w.conv_conv_w, GGML_TYPE_F16)`.

## ggml_gallocr works with model weight tensors

Model weight tensors that already have a backend buffer are skipped
by `ggml_gallocr_alloc_graph` — it only allocates compute tensors.
So model weights can be used directly as operands in graphs allocated
with gallocr. No need for `ggml_backend_sched` for this use case.

However: `ggml_add` with a 1D bias tensor (ne[0]=D) broadcasts
correctly over a 2D tensor (D, N) — no `ggml_repeat` needed.
Using `ggml_repeat` with a reshaped view of a weight tensor can
cause subtle issues.

## Dequantizing backend tensors to CPU

Model weight tensors in Q8_0/Q4_K backend buffers can't be read
with `ggml_backend_tensor_get(t, dst, 0, nelements*sizeof(float))`
— that reads raw quantized bytes. Use:
```cpp
std::vector<uint8_t> raw(ggml_nbytes(t));
ggml_backend_tensor_get(t, raw.data(), 0, raw.size());
ggml_get_type_traits(t->type)->to_float(raw.data(), out, nelements);
```

## Cache dequantized weights for CPU-side ops

When CPU-side operations (BiLSTM, layer fusion) read quantized model
weights every call, the dequant overhead adds ~50-100ms per call.
Cache the F32 versions in the context struct at init time — they're
small (~52 MB for BiLSTM + fuser weights) and eliminate per-call cost.

## Batched span MLP via ggml graph: 2-3x speedup

GLiNER's span scoring evaluates hundreds of spans, each through a
2-layer MLP (3072→4096→1024). The naive approach runs each span as a
separate CPU scalar matmul. Batching all spans into a single ggml
`mul_mat` (3072, n_spans) × (3072, 4096) leverages BLAS and gives
2-3.5x speedup on the GLiNER head.

Two-pass approach works well: pass 1 computes proj_start/end/first +
prompt_rep (independent of spans), then CPU assembles span
concatenations, pass 2 computes batched out_project + scoring.
